# Task 2
Application interaction with OS type UNIX. Multithreaded programming using POSIX threads. Working with shared memory.
Linker and external libraries Optimization of work with RAM and CPU cache memory.

### Individual task condition
Perhaps we have squared matrix size of 10,000 x 10,000 digits. Write an algorithm to compute each diagonal sum 
elements. Then white a paralleled algorithm to complete the same task using several processes and optimization
of work with cache memory.
